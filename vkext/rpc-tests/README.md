Before test running you need to clone engine repo.

Run tests from vkext/rpc-tests directory with the following command:

`./run-tests.py --engine-repo <path-to-engine-repo>`

It's possible to run with valgrind:

`run-tests.py --valgrind --engine-repo <path-to-engine-repo>`

Output of it can be found in `vkext/rpc-tests/valgrind.out`.
