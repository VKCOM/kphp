# Working with external DBs

```danger
Historically, KPHP was maintained proprietary at VK.com â€” where all data is sent and received via TL/RPC.  
That's why KPHP never needed support for Postgres connectors, etc.  
This probably will be done in the future, but as of the first public release, it's the main obstacle to applicability.
