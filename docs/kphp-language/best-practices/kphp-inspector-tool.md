# kphp-inspector: query codegenerated sources

After KPHP converts PHP to C++, lots of codegenerated files appear in the output folder. It may be a point of interest to investigate such questions:
* How does the C++ source of a specific function look like?
* How types of local vars and arguments were inferred?
* Was the function automatically inlined?

**kphp-inspector** is a console tool to analyze codegenerated sources.

It is not a part of the KPHP compiler, it is kept and maintained in another repository â€” **kphp-tools**.
