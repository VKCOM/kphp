# PHP snippets

```tip
"Snippets" are libraries written in PHP aimed to be compiled with KPHP.
```

Due to typing restrictions and syntax limitations, KPHP won't compile any existing *not-too-primitive* PHP library without modifications.

A possible solution is:
* either to write a library by yourself (or port an existing library, adapting its code)
* or to inquire about the already written library — maybe, somebody has already done and published it

As of the first public release, there is no package manager — instead, we created **a repository with various libraries** and fragments of PHP code, that are compatible with KPHP.

Feel free to contribute to this repository if you got something to share.
