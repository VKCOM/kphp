# kphp-diff-comparator tool

**kphp-diff-comparator** is a console tool to compare outputs of two KPHP versions.

When you refactor KPHP, of course, you have your site or pet project to be launched.  
A typical case is when you want to ensure, that your changes to KPHP sources don't affect site codegeneration — or if they do, they are expected.
  
This tool performs fast comparing (fast even for 100k files), outputs brief diff info, and logs detailed diff.

It is not a part of the KPHP compiler, it is kept and maintained in another repository — **kphp-tools**.
