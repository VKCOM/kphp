# Compiling KPHP from sources

KPHP can be compiled for Debian systems. Public builds are available for Buster and Ubuntu.

We have not tested if KPHP can be compiled for a non-Debian system. If you have luck, please let us know.


## Where all sources are located

All KPHP sources are [on GitHub]({{site.url_github_kphp}}), distributed under the GPLv3 license.  
These are sources of KPHP, vkext, flex data (for Russian declensions), and all TL tools.

KPHP linkage depends on some custom packages, that are also compiled from source:
* patched curl build [on GitHub]({{site.url_package_curl}}) (branch *dpkg-build-7.60.0*)
* custom uber-h3 build [on GitHub]({{site.url_package_h3}}) (branch *dpkg-build*)
* epoll implementation for MacOS [on GitHub]({{site.url_package_epoll_shim}}) (branch *osx-platform*)
* custom timelib build [on GitHub]({{site.url_package_timelib}}) (branch *master*)

KPHP is compiled with CMake and packed with CPack.


## Prerequisites

rm -f "$TEMP_DEB"
# for postgresql

wget -qO - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | apt-key add - 
```
Install packages
```bash
apt-get update
apt install git cmake-data=3.16* cmake=3.16* make g++ gperf python3-minimal python3-jsonschema \
            curl-kphp-vk libuber-h3-dev kphp-timelib libfmt-dev libgtest-dev libgmock-dev libre2-dev libpcre3-dev \

            postgresql postgresql-server-dev-all libpq-dev libldap-dev libkrb5-dev
```


##### Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)
Add external repositories
```bash
apt-get update
# utils for adding repositories
apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends apt-utils ca-certificates gnupg wget
# for curl-kphp-vk, libuber-h3-dev packages and kphp-timelib

echo "deb https://artifactory-external.vkpartner.ru/artifactory/kphp focal main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
```
Install packages
```bash
apt-get update
apt install git cmake make g++ gperf python3-minimal python3-jsonschema \
            curl-kphp-vk libuber-h3-dev kphp-timelib libfmt-dev libgtest-dev libgmock-dev libre2-dev libpcre3-dev \

            postgresql postgresql-server-dev-all libpq-dev libldap-dev libkrb5-dev
```


##### MacOS
Make sure you have `brew` and `clang` (at least `Apple clang version 10.0.0`)
```bash
# Install dependencies
brew tap shivammathur/php
brew update
brew install re2c cmake coreutils openssl libiconv re2 pcre yaml-cpp zstd googletest shivammathur/php/php@7.4
brew link --overwrite shivammathur/php/php@7.4
pip3 install jsonschema

# Build kphp
git clone https://github.com/VKCOM/kphp.git && cd kphp
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DDOWNLOAD_MISSING_LIBRARIES=On
make -j$(nproc)
```

##### Other Linux
Make sure you are using the same package list. You may use system default libcurl package, it would work, but without DNS resolving. `uber-h3` must be installed from sources.


### Recommendations
It's also recommended having a `libfmt >= 7` installed (if not, pass `-DDOWNLOAD_MISSING_LIBRARIES=On` to CMake) and `ccache`, it may speed up compilation time.  


## CMake configuration

Here are available variables, that can be modified during the `cmake` invocation:
```
DOWNLOAD_MISSING_LIBRARIES when libfmt / gtest / epoll-shim / etc not found, downloads them to a local folder [Off]
ADDRESS_SANITIZER enables the address sanitizer [Off]
UNDEFINED_SANITIZER enables the undefined sanitizer [Off]
KPHP_TESTS include tests to default target [On]
```


## Compiling KPHP

```note
We use the `make` command here, but of course, parallel compilation means `make -j$(nproc)` or env settings.
```

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```


## Compiling tl2php and other tools

This is achieved with the same command:
```bash 
# in build/ folder
make
```


## Compiling vkext

To build and install vkext locally, you need to have `php` and `php-dev` packages installed for PHP 7.2 or above.  
vkext is also compiled with CMake.

```
# in build/ folder
make
```

**Install for the default PHP version (recommended)**

```
sudo cp ../objs/vkext/modules/vkext.so $(php-config --extension-dir)
```

If you want to use it everywhere, update the global *php.ini* file by adding the following lines:
```
extension=vkext.so
tl.conffile="/path/to/scheme.tlo"
```

If you don't want to install it globally, pass it as the `-d` option to *php* instead of updating *php.ini*:
```bash
php -d extension=vkext.so -d tl.conffile=/path/to/scheme.tlo ...
```  

**Build for a specific PHP version (optional)**

Run the following script with the desirable *PHP_VERSION* (only "7.2" and "7.4" are supported so far):
```
# in build/ folder
make vkext${PHP_VERSION}
sudo cp ../objs/vkext/modules${PHP_VERSION}/vkext.so $(php-config${PHP_VERSION} --extension-dir)
```

**Compiling .tlo for php.ini**

Use the `tl-compiler` executable from `vk-tl-tools` package:
```bash
tl-compiler -e /path/to/output.tlo input1.tl input2.tl ...
```


## Building a .deb package

```bash
# in build/ folder
cpack -D CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL="KPHP;FLEX" .
```
